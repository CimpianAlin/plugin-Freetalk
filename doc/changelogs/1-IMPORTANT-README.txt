The primary, official source of changelogs is NOT this directory.

Instead, it is the content of the Git tag of each version. For example 
for "build0013", you can view (and GnuPG-verify) it with:
  git tag --verify build0013

This directory solely exists to provide a storage space for developing
*drafts* of changelogs. They may or may not be identical with the final 
changelogs.
